# Algorithm : 

# Taking input of a string s. 
# This string can be of any length, but  assumed to be at least 3 characters long since the code processes the string in chunks of 3 characters.
# First Pattern: The program iterates through the first three characters of the string s:
# For each iteration, it prints the first character followed by the second character, separated by a space. 
# This pattern is repeated for the first three characters of the string.
# Second Pattern: The program then iterates through the first three characters of the string s again:
# For each iteration, it prints the first character followed by the second character followed by the third character, separated by a space. 
# This pattern is repeated for the first three characters of the string.
