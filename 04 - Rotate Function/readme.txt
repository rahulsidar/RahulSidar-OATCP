# Algorithm 
taking input n size of array and array elements.
Initialize vector of n element.
After reading the input array, the maxRotateValue() function is called with nums as an argument.
funciton computes and returns the maximum value obtainable by rotating the array. 
This function implements a dynamic programming approach.
Inside maxRotateValue(), it calculates the initial total sum and current sum of the array elements. 
Then, it computes the maximum value that can be obtained by rotating the array at each position and stores these values in a dynamic programming table dp.
Finally, it returns the maximum value from the dp array.
at last printing the output.
